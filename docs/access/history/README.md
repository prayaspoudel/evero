# Implementation History

This directory contains historical documentation from the SSO project implementation phases. These documents are preserved for reference but are not required for current development.

## Historical Phase Documents

### Phase 2: Enhanced Authentication
- **PHASE2_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - 2FA, OAuth 2.0 implementation details
- **PHASE2_COMPLETE.md** - Phase 2 completion summary

### Phase 3: External Services  
- **PHASE3_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - Email, SMS, social login implementation
- **PHASE3_COMPLETE.md** - Phase 3 completion summary

## Current Documentation

For current development, refer to the main documentation:

- **[ACCESS_README.md](../../ACCESS_README.md)** - Main access module guide
- **[IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](../IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Complete feature summary
- **[MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](../MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)** - Migration from SSO guide
- **[QUICK_REFERENCE.md](../QUICK_REFERENCE.md)** - Quick reference guide
- **[IMPLEMENTATION.md](../IMPLEMENTATION.md)** - Implementation details

## Note

These phase documents describe the original SSO project implementation. The access module has since been:
- Migrated to Evero as a module
- Converted from Gin to Fiber v2
- Integrated into the modular monolith architecture
- Updated with clean architecture patterns

While the core functionality remains the same, implementation details may differ from these historical documents.
